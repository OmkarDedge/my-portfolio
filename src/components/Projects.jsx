          <p>
            The Job Portal System is a secure web application designed to
            connect job seekers and employers efficiently. It features robust
            user authentication with JWT token-based authorization for secure
            access to sensitive areas. Administrators can manage job postings
            through comprehensive CRUD functionalities, ensuring up-to-date and
            relevant listings. Users benefit from personalized job analytics and
            statistics, empowering them with insights into their application
            history and success rates. Implemented security measures, including
            cross-site scripting prevention and database security against SQL
            injection, safeguard user data and interactions. The system aims to
            provide a seamless user experience while maintaining stringent
            security protocols for all stakeholders involved.

            chat groups for organized discussions. Additionally, users have the
            capability to manage their profiles, ensuring personalized
            interaction experiences. Security measures include protection
            against cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection, securing user
            data and interactions. With a responsive design and intuitive
            interface, the system aims to provide a user-friendly and secure
            platform for efficient communication and profile management across
            all stakeholders.

          <h3>Path Finder (React.js, Dijkstra Algorithm)</h3>
          <p>
            The Path Finder Application, implemented using React, provides a
            user-friendly interface to explore shortest paths using the Dijkstra
            algorithm while navigating through obstacles. Users can designate a
            start node and an end node on a grid-based layout. By holding the
            left mouse button, they can draw obstacles directly on the grid,
            dynamically updating the pathfinding algorithm to navigate around
            these barriers. The application leverages React's state management
            to handle user interactions seamlessly, ensuring real-time updates
            to the shortest path calculation as nodes and obstacles are
            modified. This project demonstrates interactive visualization of
            pathfinding algorithms in action, enhancing understanding and
            usability through intuitive graphical representation.

          <h3>Sorting Visualizer (React.js, Merge-Sort Algorithm)</h3>
          <p>
            The Merge Sort Visualizer, developed in React, provides an
            interactive platform to visualize the Merge Sort algorithmâ€”a
            powerful and efficient sorting method. Users can generate random
            arrays of numbers and observe how Merge Sort divides, sorts, and
            merges these arrays to achieve a sorted sequence. The visualizer
            dynamically displays each step of the sorting process through
            animations, allowing users to grasp the inner workings of Merge Sort
            comprehensively. By enabling users to interact with randomized data
            sets, the project enhances understanding of sorting algorithms while
            showcasing React's capabilities in creating engaging educational
            tools.

            Ebola Analysis (Python, Apache Spark, AWS S3, AWS EMR, Databricks)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Ebola Data Analysis In this project, I conducted an extensive
            analysis of a 7.5 GB dataset on Ebola using Python and Apache Spark
            for big data computing. Initially, I deployed the application on
            Databricks for testing purposes to ensure robust performance and
            accurate results. After successful testing, I migrated the
            application to AWS for full-scale deployment. Utilizing AWS S3 for
            secure and scalable storage, and AWS EMR for enhanced computing
            power, I efficiently processed and analyzed the data. This
            deployment on AWS ensured scalability, reliability, and high
            performance, allowing for comprehensive statistical analysis and
            insights into the Ebola dataset.
